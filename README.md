# mitoclocks2018


## This repository consolidates all files used in the paper of Schuster et al. "Divergence times in demosponges (Porifera): first insights from new mitogenomes and the inclusion of fossils in a birth-death clock model" for analysing the divergence times in demosponges under the fossilized-birth-death model in BEAST 2.4.3. 

The files are organized in the following folders: **data**,**XML** ,**precooked_runs**, **figures**.

The **data** folder includes the alignment as well as the sequences for all new mt genomes used in this paper.
The **XML** folder includes the xml file generated by BEAST BEAUTi to run BEAST. In addition we provide the shell skript for cluster analyses. The **precooked_runs** folder include all outputfiles of the run by means of log files which can be analysed in TRACER and raw .trees files. The **figure** folder contains the outputfigures.
